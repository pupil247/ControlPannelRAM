ğŸ“Œ Project Overview

This web application is built using Node.js and npm to control an industrial panel via MQTT. It provides real-time monitoring, user authentication, alarm management, and peripheral control. The system integrates Socket.io for MQTT communication and includes SQL-based user management with role-based permissions. It is part of a larger project including the Industrial pannel control with raspberry PI in Linux.
